Axios:
 Axios is a JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests, allowing easy interaction
 with APIs and web services, both in web browsers and Node.js.

CORS:
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls how web pages from one domain can request and access resources from another domain. It helps protect sensitive data and prevents unauthorized access to resources on different websites. Servers need to include specific headers to allow or deny cross-origin requests, and browsers enforce these restrictions to maintain web security.
